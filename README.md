With the help of Ramesh Fadatare, a famous youtuber, I developed an employee management system.

It displays a list of employees which the user can manipulate and the list is displayed on a localhost.
User can add,update, sort, and delete employees. 
Thymeleaf is utilized at the front end, and Spring MVC, business logic, and DAO pattern are utilized at the 
backend, with MySQL working as a database to store list of employees.
